# Rift-Portfolio

*Rift Portfolio Description -*
  Welcome to my Rift Portfolio, where technology and inspiration converge. Delve into a 3D experience created using Three.js and React, heavily inspired by the Summoner's Rift from League of Legends. Traverse the main area, reliving my latest journey through interactive landscapes that portray my projects and experiences so far.
  
* Currently, only the Rift's main area is available within the website for V1. Future updates will allow users to interact with portals for my experiences/projects and maybe more...
